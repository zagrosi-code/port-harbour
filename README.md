**Computer *ports* on a pixel-art *harbour*. Pun + pleonasm (*port* = *harbour*). Both intended. 🚢**

⭐ Now on the VS Code Marketplace: [Port Harbour](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zagrosi-code.port-harbour).

</div>

Your listening sockets are fishing boats moored at the seawall. Your Docker containers light up windows in the red palazzo on the right. The cathedral keeps real time. The lighthouse rotates. The sun rises and sets with your system clock.
